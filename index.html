    <p>Hello, my name is Daniel Mukonda from Johannesburg South Africa, I enjoy working with and empower underserved
      communities through access to quality education and mentorship. Growing up in a disadvantaged community and having
      to learn skills and trades under difficult circumstances inspired me to helping young people. I use my skills to
      train, coach, and inspire young people, especially those lacking father figuresâ€”to build strong values, grow with
      purpose, and lead meaningful lives. By helping them become leaders in their own communities, I aim to spark a
      cycle of positive change that empowers others in turn.
