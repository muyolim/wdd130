    <p>Hello, my name is Daniel Mukonda from Johannesburg, South Africa. I enjoy working with and empowering underserved
      communities through access to quality education and mentorship. Growing up in a disadvantaged community and
      learning
      skills under difficult circumstances inspired me to help young people. I use my skills to train, coach, and
      inspire
      young peopleâ€”especially those lacking father figuresâ€”to build strong values, grow with purpose, and lead
      meaningful
      lives. By helping them become leaders in their own communities, I aim to spark a cycle of positive change that
      empowers others in turn.</p>

    <p>Born out of a late-19th-century gold rush, Johannesburg â€” or Egoli, meaning â€˜place of goldâ€™ in Zulu â€” rapidly
      grew to become South Africaâ€™s economic engine. Today, the cityâ€™s many ethnicities and cultures can be explored
      through its food, music and thriving arts scene..</p>
