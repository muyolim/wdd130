        Born out of a late-19th-century gold rush, Johannesburg â€” or Egoli, meaning â€˜place of goldâ€™ in Zulu â€” rapidly
        grew to become South Africaâ€™s economic engine. Today, the cityâ€™s many ethnicities and cultures can be explored
        through its food, music and thriving arts scene.

      <p>
        Hello, my name is Daniel Mukonda from Johannesburg, South Africa. I enjoy working with and empowering underserved
        communities through access to quality education and mentorship. Growing up in a disadvantaged community and
        learning skills under difficult circumstances inspired me to help young people. I use my skills to train, coach,
        and inspire young peopleâ€”especially those lacking father figuresâ€”to build strong values, grow with purpose, and
        lead meaningful lives. By helping them become leaders in their own communities, I aim to spark a cycle of positive
        change that empowers others in turn.
